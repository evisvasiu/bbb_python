This code is designed to run in BeagleBone Black and it retrieves data from DHT11 sensor and publish the values to a cloud MQTT broker. 
The original code is taken from here https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT/blob/master/examples/AdafruitDHT.py
and has been modified by adding the MQTT library and code in order to create a MQTT client.
