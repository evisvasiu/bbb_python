This code is designed to run in BeagleBone Black.
The original code is taken from here https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT/blob/master/examples/AdafruitDHT.py
and has been modified by adding the MQTT library and code in order to create a MQTT client and publish sensor values to MQTT broker, without any security authentication.
